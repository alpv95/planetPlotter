Installing Macosx_gpib_lib
--------------------------------------------------------------------

A) First steps:
---------------

1) Installing your Hardware:

	Macosx_gpib_lib is only designed for USB adapter.
	Version 1 works only with 82357 adapter.

2) Unpacking the Software:
	Unpack the archives where you want. You might have to create
	a folder to copy the files in.
	Please ensure that the folder configuration is similar to the
	following:
	root.
	|-gpib.py (the Python wrapper)
	|-gpibtest.py
	|-libmacosx_gpib_lib.dylib (the library which connects to usb)
	|-82357a_fw.hex (FW for 82357A - not included!)
	|-measat_releaseX1.8.hex (FW for 82357B - not included!)


B) Loading the driver modules
-----------------------------

1) USB devices

	Your device requires an external firmware but this last is not
	included within the Macosx_gpib_lib package; a tarball is available
	from http://linux-gpib.sourceforge.net/firmware/. Here you'll find
        the requested files: 82357a_fw.hex for 82357A and measat_releaseX1.8.hex
        for 82357B.
	Macosx_gpib_lib will load it automatically as long as the right
	firmware resides in the main working directory (see (A-2)).
		
E) Trying it out
----------------

	You may find the examples gpibtest.py program useful as a starting
	point in trying out your setup. Open it and modify it according
	to your hardware and type >>>Python gpibtest.py.
        As macosx_gpib_lib is a port from linux-gpib you'll find more
        information on the linux-gpib project and website that will be valid for
        macosx_gpib_lib.

F) Bindings for other languages
-------------------------------

	Please have a look at gpib_visa.h to see how to wrap with the 
	Macosx_gpib_lib library.

G) Uninstalling
---------------

	Just delete the folder which contains the file listed in (A-2)
